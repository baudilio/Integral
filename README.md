Integral
========
It is advisable that every project/repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

This is the README.md file in my Integral repository.
I guess this file is intended to describe the purpose of the poject.

'Integral' is a F90 code that calculates the integral of a data set
using the trapezoidal rule/method.
